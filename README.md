# Sorting Visualizer

This Sorting Visualizer has been my first own micro-project, that I started working on during the quarantine in 2020 spring.

The project has helped gaining a deep understanding on sorting methods, whilst made me more familiar with the possibilities provided by Blazor. The framework was still considered new at that time, hence overcoming certain challenges has been a great part of the project.

The sorting setup can be customized by:
* Choose between bubble selection and insertion sorting algorithms
* Adjusting the range in which the numbers are generated
* Tune the speed of visualization
